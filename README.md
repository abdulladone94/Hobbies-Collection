Reflection

This was a 3 days long project built during my interview practice test of Software and Design. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to give awsome collection of hobbis based on what they were interested in, such as 'efficient time management'. I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then adding react-router-dom@5 and express.
